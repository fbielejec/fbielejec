### What am I up to now

* I am fascinated by the society-changing potential of the blockchain technologies!
* Together with [jpmonettas](https://github.com/jpmonettas) we maintain [Spread](https://github.com/fbielejec/spread), software that visualizes how pathogens and viruses (yes, the ones like COVID-19) spread in time and space.
* I have have a keen interest in functional programming, especially using Clojure and Rust.
* I often write on my [my blog](https://www.blog.nodrama.io/) about different computing topics.
* I like all things outdoor - from climbing, cycling, skiing to simply hiking.
